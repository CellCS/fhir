<p>You are currently looking at the core FHIR specification, which is the technical foundation on which an extremely wide range of healthcare solutions can be based.  
However, this specification is only one part of the resources needed to achieve successful interoperability.  The other critical factor is engagement with and support
from the FHIR community.</p>

<p>In addition to being a specification, FHIR is also an extended community of individuals from a wide range of backgrounds who are interested in improving the 
healthcare system, both for patients and their caregivers, as well as for those who work in the system.  As part of implementing
FHIR, it is inevitable that some aspect of the FHIR specification will leave you with questions - Which resource should be used?  Which architectural approach is
best? How should a given search or operation be performed or defined?  You may also occasionally find areas were the specification is unclear, misleading, or even
outright wrong.  We <b>want</b> you to reach out when this happens.</p>

<h2>Participating</h2>
<p>To maximize your chances of interoperability success, to minimize your own costs, and to improve the specification for others, we invite and encourage all
readers to engage in the community.  We try hard to be open, welcoming, and helpful - and will do our best to assist in whatever you're trying to do.</p>

<p>At minimum, you should sign up for <a href="http://chat.fhir.org">chat.fhir.org</a>.  While it requires free registration, it is given to everyone provided they
agree to abide by our <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Chat.fhir.org+Community+Expectations">Community Guidelines</a>.  We will not use your email 
address for any purpose other than password resets.  
This forum has a wide number of streams related to different topics in healthcare.  Subscribe to the ones of interest, set up notifications for keywords of interest,
and search for pre-existing answers to questions from others.  If you don't find the information you need, then ask your own questions (though it's best to look at
the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/FHIR+Rules+for+Asking+Questions">Rules for Asking Questions</a> first.  This is the best way to get community guidance.</p>

<p>If you find issues with the specification, you can submit feedback using the 'Propose a change' link at the bottom of any page in our specification.  This link
will take you to HL7's Jira site.  It requires a one-time (free) <a href="https://jira.hl7.org/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=11200&amp;issuetype=11300">Jira registration</a> 
process where we'll attempt to verify that you're a real human, after which you can submit feedback at will.  HL7's confluence site includes a page with 
<a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/HL7/Specification+Feedback">guidance on registering for and using Jira</a> to submit feedback.</p>

<p>The FHIR specification is developed under the auspices of Health Level Seven, International (HL7), who is an ANSI accredited standards developer.  Anyone
who wishes to participate in <a href="http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees">HL7 work groups</a> to help evaluate feedback and make decisions on the future evolution of 
the FHIR spec is welcome to do so.  We encourage you to support HL7's work by <a href="http://hl7.org/participate/membership">registering as an HL7 member</a>.  This 
provides an opportunity to vote on specifications, discounts on education and meetings, and other benefits.  It also helps to fund the infrastructure on which the community 
relies.  That said, participation in work group calls does not require being a member.  The level of your involvement can vary.  Try going to a few meetings of different
groups and see what might be a good fit.</p>

<p>The community gathers multiple times a year at events such as <a href="http://hl7.org/events/workgroupmeetings.cfm">working group meetings</a>, 
<a href="http://hl7.org/events/fhir-connectathon/">connectathons</a>, and <a href="https://www.devdays.com">DevDays</a>.
There are also meetings organized by <a href="https://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/international/leadership.cfm">HL7 affiliates</a> and informal meetings organized 
by the community.  (A good way to be aware of these additional meetings is to participate in chat.fhir.org.)  Some of these are virtual, others are in person.  If you 
have the opportunity to attend, they're a great way to broaden your knowledge and build your network.  They're often a wource of energy and inspiration.</p>

<h2>Special requests</h2>
<p>If you feel you are a member of an under-represented group in the healthcare interoperability space - based on your gender, country, profession, or any other
consideration, please know that you are not only welcome, but that your voice and opinions are especially valued.  Healthcare is innately diverse, as are the
problems involved in providing optimal care to patients world-wide.  FHIR covers an incredibly wide spectrum of care - inpatient, outpatient, research, veterinary, 
social services, public health, financial, and others.  We need the ideas, creativity, and feedback of everyone to maximize the benefit that FHIR can provide.</p>

<p>The FHIR community strives to be a safe place for everyone.  While we expect and encourage healthy debate about how the specification should involve, we
expect all participants to be respectful and adhere to the <a href="https://hl7.org/legal/code-of-conduct.cfm">HL7 Code of Conduct</a>.  If the actions of another 
community member leave you feeling unwelcome or uncomfortable, please let us know so we can help make things right.</p>

<p>Finally, we're not only interested in feedback about problems or suggested changes, the community also values information about what we've done right.
We've started a special stream on chat.fhir.org to capture your <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/392112-FHIR-Successes">FHIR Successes</a>.  
Let us know where FHIR has made a positive difference and how its helping make patients and/or the healthcare system better.</p>

<p>FHIR represents tens of thousands of hours by an enormous number of people.  We've achieved some notable successes in making healthcare better, but there's
still a long way to go.  Thanks for joining us in that work.</p>
