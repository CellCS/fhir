<h3>Version Comparison</h3>

<p>
Canonical resources may have both a version, and a version algorithm. In normal
usage, implementers are strongly recommended to version all the canonical resources
that they maintain. The difference between the CanonicalResource version (business version)
and the Resource version in <code>.meta.version</code> is discussed 
<a href="resource.html#versions">on Resource</a>.
</p>
<p>
The version algorithm allows applications to choose the correct latest version of a 
resource, since there is no general algorithm that chooses the latest version across
all versioning schemes in place.
</p>
<p>
Implementers are encouraged to use semantic versioning, but may have existing approaches
that are already adopted.

[%impl-note%]
This mechanism we have for defining version comparison algorithm, where each
version of the resource makes its own claim about how version comparison works
is inelegant and feels somewhat clunky, but that it was the best that the committee identified 
that could find that would work in all circumstances. Alternative proposals that could be used 
to address the problem that would be less onerous are welcome.
