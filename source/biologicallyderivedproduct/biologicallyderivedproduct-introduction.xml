<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
A NutritionalProduct, such as breast milk, fruits, vegetables, etc., distinguishes from a BiologicallyDerivedProduct, although a NutritionalProduct is mostly biological and could be processed for further use, its primary purpose is nutrition, not therapeutic, and consumed by mouth or tube feeding, not intravenously.  Note that parenteral nutrition, e.g., TPN or Lipids, is not considered a NutritionalProduct, rather a medication.
