    <p>
      Rapid advances in sequencing technologies, clinical genetics tests for
      whole genome and exome sequencing are allowing sophisticated genetics
      testing to be used by providers and patients in clinical decisions.
      Results from such tests are used to identify distinct genetic variants
      that may contribute to syndromes, conditions and/or predictive responses
      to treatments. The implementation of precision medicine will depend upon
      having such data to diagnose patients, choose medications, and predict the
      course of disease and care, but will require standards and effective user
      interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      A current technical challenge exists in interoperability - the ability to
      access and share genetics data in a consistant way. The challenges of
      interoperability includes collection, coding, and retrieval to scale. An
      individual's genetic data set is large, complex and requires curation.
      Unfortunately, incompatible systems and nomenclatures are already in use.
      A standards-based ontology that could be adopted to integrate both genetic
      data and clinical information systems will be crucial to accelerating the
      integration of precision medicine and to make sense of genetic testing
      results in a complete clinical context.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve these challenges, FHIR is attractive because it is widely adopted
      across a number of clinical systems. The clinical requirements for
      genetics data is, relative to genomics research needs, utilitarian and
      reductive because it is about distilling and extracting particular
      genetics data produced by ever more sophisticated testing for use at the
      point-of-care. This has made FHIR a very functional framework to initiate
      an interoperable clinical genetics data standardization to which multiple
      stakeholders have contributed to this guide.

    <p>
      To facilitate the reporting of genomic data in FHIR, the
      <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/genomics-reporting/index.html">
        Genomics Reporting Implementation Guide
      </a>
      is being developed. This implementation guide focuses on data structures -
      what data should be/might be present and how it should be organized. It
      does not address workflows around how reports are requested, created,
      approved, routed, delivered, amended, etc. The implementation guide is
      also paradigm-independent - the data structures presented here could be
      used in RESTful, messaging, documents or other mechanisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional, this FHIR specification includes the
      <a href="molecularsequence.html">MolecularSequence</a> resource that is
      designed for representing a sequence. Sequences can be represented a
      number of ways to suit the use case.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the combination of the Implementation Guide and the MolecularSequence
      resource, FHIR can support a large set of clinical use cases and is thus
      positioned to address emergent -omics use cases. These tools are simple to
      implement, will optimize payload sizes, and help developers avoid
      redundant retrieval of data.
