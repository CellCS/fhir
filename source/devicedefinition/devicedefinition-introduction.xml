<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
Devices include durable (reusable) medical equipment, implantable devices, as well as disposable equipment used for diagnostic, treatment, and research for healthcare and public health, as well as devices such as a machine, cellphone, computer, software, application, etc.  The DeviceDefinition resource is used to describe the common characteristics and capabilities of a device of a certain type or kind, e.g., a certain model or class of a device such as a x-ray model or personal wearable device model, whereas a Device resource documents an actual instance of a device such as the actual x-ray machine that is installed or the personal wearable device being worn.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>
The DeviceDefinition resource contains the "catalog" definition of a device - whether that definition is authored by the manufacturer or a regulatory entity and allows defining valid hierarchical device configurations (devices as part of other devices).

Device vs deviceDefinition:
Device vs deviceDefinition: The Device resource is meant to refer to a physical instance of a device - hence having attributes like lot number, patient, location, operational status which the DeviceDefinition resource does not have.
