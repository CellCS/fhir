<p>
A Logical Data Model or Logical Model is a representation of data structures, that is independent of a physical implementation.
</p>
<p>
Logical Models contain data elements (entities and attributes) and their constraints and relationships. They allows data requirements to be described from a functional perspective, without attaching to a specific implementation or technology. 
</p>
<p>
FHIR Logical Models are a FHIR representation of a Logical Model.  Although a FHIR Logical Model  is captured as a FHIR representation, it does not imply that the Logical Model represents or is attached to a FHIR implementation.
(Other formats for representing Logical Models are visual models (UML ER diagrams), and proprietary formats, such as Enterprise Architect. )

FHIR Logical Models provide a computable description of a Logical Data Model, with the necessary metadata for design, validation and implementation.

<h3>Usage</h3>
<h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>
FHIR Logical Models are typically used to capture the functional data requirements before an implementation. 
Analysts determine the functional data needs - attributes, data types, cardinalities, relationships, bindings, etc. 
The Logical Model is free from technical constraints and can be validated on a functional level. 
Technical implementers can then map Logical Models to an implementation. A Logical Model can be implemented as one or several FHIR resources (including extensions). 
The implementation can also be in other standards such as HL7 CDA, SPL, GS1 XML, etc. 
The Logical Model provides a common representation of the data needs.
</p>
<h4>Crosswalk / Mapping</h4>
<p>
When supporting a migration from one standard to another, or when using a different version of FHIR, having a Logical Model that represents the data needs allows the functional description to be used as a pivot point to any conversion.

<h3>Content</h3>
<h4>Data Elements</h4>
<h4></h4>Data Types
<h4>Terminology</h4>
<p>
In Logical Models, Terminology bindings capture the functional vocabulary constraints. For example, civil status, or state codes are important vocabularies that are defined in functional analysis - typically they are legal impositions or local practice.
</p>


<h4>Mappings</h4>
<p>
LMs can map to conceptual terminologies such as SNOMED CT -
