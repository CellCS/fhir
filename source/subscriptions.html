<p>
  Subscriptions are used to establish proactive event notifications from a FHIR application to another system. Applications which have implemented support for Subscriptions will advertise their use via the resources <a href="subscription.html">Subscription</a> and <a href="subscriptiontopic.html">SubscriptionTopic</a>. Operations allowed on these resources may be discovered via the FHIR Application's <a href="capabilitystatement.html">CapabilityStatement</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The FHIR Subscription mechanism is composed of three parts:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="subscriptiontopic.html">SubscriptionTopic</a> resources
      <ul>
        <li>Define the <b>data</b> and <b>change</b> used to trigger notifications</li>
        <li>Define the filters allowed to clients</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="subscription.html">Subscription</a> resources
      <ul>
        <li>Describe a client's request to be notified about events defined in a <code>SubscriptionTopic</code></li>
        <li>Set filters on events (as defined in the referenced <code>SubscriptionTopic</code>)</li>
        <li>Describe the <a href="#channels">channel</a> and endpoint used to send notifications</li>
        <li>Describe the payload included in notifications (MIME type, content level, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="bundle.html#subscription-notification">subscription-notification Bundles</a>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe a notification (using a <a href="subscriptionstatus.html">SubscriptionStatus</a>)</li>
        <li>Contain zero or more notification payloads</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  This document contains general information about the Subscriptions framework in FHIR.  Documentation about specific values (e.g., the <code>rest-hook</code> channel type) can be found in the appropriate resource documentation.  For convenience, below is a list of common topics and links to their documentation.
</p>

<table class="grid">

    <tr>

  <tbody>

</table>

<p>
  Payload content levels are defined to allow different amounts of information to be communicated in notifications:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#payloads-empty"><b>empty</b></a>: Notifications include NO information about any resource involved triggering the notificaiton</li>
    <li><a href="#payloads-id-only"><b>id-only</b></a>: Notifications include the ID of the resource which triggered the notificaiton</li>
    <li><a href="#payloads-full-resource"><b>full-resource</b></a>: Notifications include the entirety of the resource which triggered the notificaiton</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Several channels are defined in the core specification:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#rest-hook"><b>rest-hook</b></a>: Notifications are sent via HTTPS POST to the <code>Subscription.endpoint</code> URL (e.g., <code>https://...</code>)</li>
    <li><a href="#websockets"><b>websocket</b></a>: Notifications are sent via WS/S to a client connected via a WebSocket</li>
    <li><a href="#email"><b>email</b></a>: Notifications are sent via SMTP/S, S/MIME, or Direct SMTP to the <code>Subscription.endpoint</code> email URI (e.g., <code>mailto:...</code>)</li>
    <li><a href="#messaging"><b>message</b></a>: Notifications are sent via <a href="messaging.html">FHIR messaging</a> to the application identified in the <code>Subscription.endpoint</code> URI</li>
  </ul>

  Additional channel types can be <a href="#channel-extending">defined</a> by external implementation guides.
  See below for further discussion of the various channels.

<a name="basic-assumptions"/>
<h2>Basic Assumptions</h2>







<a name="safety"/>
<h2>Safety and Security</h2>
<p>
  Applications are responsible for following <a href="security.html">FHIR security guidance</a>.  Some recommendations specific to subscriptions are provided below.
</p>
<p>
  A subscription is a request for future event notifications. As with any client-initiated interaction, Subscriptions could request information that a client is not allowed to see, and applications SHALL enforce authorization in accordance with their policy requirements. Applications SHOULD take a subscription's <code>SubscriptionTopic</code> and filters into account when authorizing the creation of a <code>Subscription</code>, and SHOULD ensure that authorization is (still) in place at the time of each event notification.
</p>
<p>
  When sending an event notification, applications can adopt various strategies to ensure that authorization is still in place. Some strategies may provide imperfect assurance (e.g., a server might rely on signed tokens with some pre-specified lifetime as evidence of authorization). In addition to these strategies, servers can mitigate the risk of disclosing sensitive information by limiting the payload types it supports (e.g., by prohibiting certain clients from requesting <code>full-resource</code> notification payloads and relying instead on <code>id-only</code> payloads).
</p>
<p>
  <code>Subscription</code> resources are not intended to be secure storage for secrets (e.g., OAuth Client ID or Tokens, etc.).  Implementers MAY use their judgement on including limited-use secrets (e.g., a token supplied in <code>Subscription.header</code> to verify that a message is from the desired source).
</p>
<p>
  Each notification sent by the application could reveal information about the application and subscriber relationship, as well as sensitive administrative or clinical information. Applications are responsible for ensuring appropriate security is employed for each channel they support. The <code>Subscription</code> resource does not address these concerns directly; it is assumed that these are administered by other configuration processes. For instance, an application might maintain a whitelist of acceptable endpoints or trusted certificate authorities for <code>rest-hook</code> channels.
</p>

<a name="errors"/>
<h2>Managing Subscriptions and Errors</h2>
<p>
  The subscription resource is authored by the client with an initial status of <code>requested</code>. A new subscription is created on the server using the RESTful create or update interaction. After a successful transaction, the client parses the Location header and saves the new Subscription's logical id for use in subsequent operations.
</p>
<p>
  When the server receives a subscription, it <b>SHOULD</b> check that it is prepared to accept/process the subscription. If it is, it sets the subscription to <code>requested</code> and process it like a normal <a href="http.html#create">create</a>. If it isn't, it <b>SHOULD</b> return an error with an <a href="operationoutcome.html">OperationOutcome</a> instead of processing the <code>create</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The criteria are subject to the same limitations as the client that created it, such as access to patient compartments etc. Note that the subscription MAY remain active after the client access tokens expire.
</p>
<p>
  Once the server has activated the subscription, it sets the status to <code>active</code> (note: the server may do this as it accepts the resource if it wants).
</p>
<p>
  An appropriately authorized client can use search and/or history operations to see what subscriptions are currently active on the server. Once the subscription is no longer desired, the client deletes the subscription from the server.
</p>
<p>
  The server may retry the notification a fixed number of times and/or refer errors to its own alert logs. If the notification fails, the server <b>SHOULD</b> set the status to <code>error</code> and mark the error in the resource. If the notification succeeds, the server <b>SHOULD</b> update the status to <code>active</code> and may remove any error codes. If a subscription fails consistently a server may choose set the subscription status to <code>off</code> and stop trying to send notifications.
</p>
<p>
  Errors a server wishes to make accessible to clients are stored in <code>Subscription.error</code>. Servers should provide a mechanism for clearing errors (e.g., when resetting a <code>Subscription.status</code> back to <code>requested</code> after an error). Since <code>Subscription.error</code> represents server errors, a server <b>SHOULD NOT</b> allow clients to add errors.
</p>

<a name="tracking"/>
<h2>Tracking Subscription Notifications</h2>
<p>
  Servers implementing Subscriptions are responsible for complying with their policies on information logging.  Servers are encouraged to track all sent notifications, for example with the use of <a href="auditevent.html">AuditEvent</a> or <a href="communication.html">Communication</a> resources.
