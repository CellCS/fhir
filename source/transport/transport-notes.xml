  <h2>Transport Titles</h2>
  <p>
     Transports often have titles (eg "My Transports", "Outstanding Transports for Patient X") which can be presented in a list.  The transport title should go into the Transport.code as a coded concept and/or text.

  <h2>Transport state machine</h2>
  <p>
    The following diagram reflects the "typical" state machine for Transport.  Note that not all states will be supported by all workflows
    and that some workflows may support additional transitions, including transitions from terminal states (e.g. back to "in-progress"
    from "failed" or "completed").

  <h2>The Cancelled state</h2>
  <p>
    While the intention of a "cancelled" transport is that all work authorized by the transport should cease, this
    might not always be possible practice.  It is possible that the originally requested action could still
    be completed and still attached to the Transport but this would not change the status of the transport.  If the
    placer cancels a transport, it signals they no longer care about the outcome of the transport.
