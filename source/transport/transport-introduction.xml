    <h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
    <p>
      A transport resource describes an activity that can be performed and tracks the state of
      completion of that activity. It is a representation that an activity should be or has been
      initiated, and eventually, represents the successful or unsuccessful completion of that
      activity.
    </p>
    <p> Note that there are a variety of processes associated with making and processing orders.
      Some orders may be handled immediately by automated systems but most require real world
      actions by one or more humans. Some orders can only be processed when other real world actions
      happen, such as a patient presenting themselves so that the action to be performed
      can actually be performed. Often these real world dependencies are only implicit in the order
      details. </p>

    <h2>Background and Context</h2>
    <h3>Using Transports in a RESTful context</h3>
    <p>In a RESTful context, a server functions as a repository of transports. The server itself, or
      other agents are expected to monitor transport activity and initiate appropriate actions to ensure
      transport completion, updating the status of the transport as it proceeds through its various stages of
      completion. These agents can be coordinated, following well choreographed business logic to
      ensure that transports are completed. Transport management may also be centrally controlled using some
      form of a workflow engine, in which case, the workflow engine itself may update and maintain the
      transport resources in the server, and through its orchestration activities ensure that transports are
      completed. The transport resource enables either model of transport management yet provides a
      consistent view of the status of transports being executed in support of healthcare workflows. </p>
    <p>The assignment of transports into categories by type of transport, type of performer and transport status
      enable the server to function as a queue of work items.  This queue can be polled or subscribed
      to by various agents, enabling automation of workflows in FHIR using existing search and subscription
      mechanisms.  Owners, requesters, other agents (e.g. workflow managers) can thus be ready to
      initiate the next steps in a complex workflow.</p>
    <h3>Transports State Machine</h3>
    <p>Transports start in a Created state. Once they have been assigned to an owner they transition to
      the Ready state, indicating that they are ready to be performed. Once the owner initiates
      activity on the transport, the transport transitions to the In Progress state, indicating that work is
      being performed. Upon normal completion, the transport enters the Completed state. If there is a
      failure during the transport execution that prevents the transport from being completed, it can also
      enter a Failed state, indicating an abnormal termination of the transport. A transport in any
      non-terminal state may also be Cancelled, representing an abnormal termination of the transport due
      to external forces, rather than an error condition.</p>
    <p>Transports in any non-terminal state (Created, Ready, In Progress) can be suspended and resumed.
      When a transport is suspended, it is typically resumed in the state it was in when it was
      originally suspended. Suspending a transport suspends all of its children as well. Resuming a transport
      resumes all of its children.</p>
    <p>An In-progress transport can also be stopped, returning it to a Ready state. This may be in
      preparation for delegation or reassignment (e.g., because it cannot be completed by the
      current owner), to restart a transport due to a temporary failure (e.g., to reattempt completion of
      the activity), or in preparation to allow others to claim the transport.</p>
<!--    <h3>Using Transports with operations</h3>
    <p>The Transport resource defines several operations to enable rich control over the transport execution
      environment. A server managing transport resources may allow unfettered read access to all transports
      that it maintains, but restrict write access to the transport resources to itself in order to exert
      control over the transport state machine. Instead, it might offer operations on transports that enable
      strictly controlled write operations following commonly accepted business rules for transport
      management. For example, only transports that are in the "In Process" state might be allowed to be
      "Completed" or "Failed". Use or support of these operations is not essential in simple
      workflow environments where transport activity needs little management. </p>
    <p>There is no distinct operation for creating a new transport because the FHIR RESTful API already
      distinguishes between the create and update operations.</p>-->
    <p>The transport history allows applications monitoring the state of a workflow to identify transports
      that are long running, perhaps stuck in some queue, to enable management activities that could
      ensure completion. It also enables tracking of transport statistics such as wait time, or time in
      progress, or time to completion, enabling capture of important transport metrics in support of
      optimization and quality improvement. </p>

    <h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>

    <p>Transport spans both intent and event and tracks the execution through to
    completion. A Transport is a workflow step such as cancelling an order,
    fulfilling an order, signing an order, merging a set of records, admitting a
    patient. In contrast, <a href="procedure.html">Procedures</a> are actions
    that are intended to result in a physical or mental change to or for the
    subject (for example, surgery, physiotherapy, training, counseling). A Transport resource
    often exists in parallel with clinical resources. For example, a Transport could
    request fulfillment of a <a href="servicerequest.html">ServiceRequest</a>
    ordering a Procedure that would result in a Procedure, <a
    href="observation.html">Observation</a>, <a
    href="diagnosticreport.html">DiagnosticReport</a>, <a
    href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> or similar resource.  Another
    example would be a Transport that requests fulfillment of a <a
    href="communicationrequest.html">CommunicationRequest</a> to be performed
    between various actors.</p>

    <p>As stated above, the transport resource tracks the state of a transport, enabling
    systems to ensure that transports are completed. This information is kept
    separate from the operational details necessary to complete the transport, as
    those details vary across and even within workflows. That detail is expected
    to be carried in the referenced `focus` of the transport. </p>

     <p>Transports may have named inputs and outputs. Inputs represent
     information that may or must be present in order for a transport to
     complete. Outputs represent intermediate or final results produced by a
     transport. For example, in a transport supporting reading of radiology image, the
     inputs might include both the imaging study to be read, as well as
     relevant prior images. Outputs could represent radiology measurements
     as well as the Radiologist's diagnostic report. </p>

    <p>Inputs and outputs are tracked by the transport because workflow
    management activity may automate the transfer of outputs from one transport
    to inputs to a subsequent transport. </p>

    <p>To facilitate the integration of off the shelf workflow applications
    with FHIR, the transport resource may reference a definition.  This
    definition can represent a description of the workflow activity to be
    performed, using a standard workflow description language such as BPEL,
    BPMN, or XPDL, a workflow definition such as those defined in IHE
    profiles, or even simple written instructions explaining a process to be
    performed.</p>
