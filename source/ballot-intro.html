<p>
Welcome to the draft ballot for FHIR Release 5 (R5) ballot. 
The R5 release of FHIR has have content with different ballot statuses: 
</p>
<ul>
 <li><span style="background-color: #e6ffe6; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Normative</b></span>: Content that is subject to normative ballot rules. Once passed, <a href="versions.html#change">strict rules</a> are imposed on future change to help ensure inter-version compatibility</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #fff5e6; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Trial Use</b></span>: Content that is undergoing <a href="versions.html#maturity">FHIR maturity Model</a> based testing. In a future ballot cycle, once sufficiently mature, it will be balloted as normative</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #ffffe6; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Informative</b></span>: Content that is advisory (e.g. implementers are not required to conform to the content), or navigational content - tables of contents, generated lists, etc.</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #efefef; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Draft</b></span>: Content added late in the balloting process that has no formal standing, but is published for visibility. It might not be suitable for use in production systems.</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #ffcccc; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>Deprecated</b></span>: Content that is in the process of being removed (see <a href="versions.html#deprecation">deprecation</a>).</li>
 <li><span style="background-color: #e6ffff; border: 1px grey solid; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;"><b>External</b></span>: Content that is replicated from external standards (e.g. HL7 v2, DICOM) and is not subject to ballot comment. This content is mostly being moved out of the specification now</li>
</ul>

<h3>The FHIR R5 Ballot Process</h3>

<p>
This is the first step in the FHIR R5 Ballot Process. The draft ballot is the start of the ovrall ballot process for 
FHIR R5. The intent is to allow the various committees that maintain content to get comments on the overall 
direction and scope of their content, and to exercise new and updated publishing and voting machinery.
</p>
<p>
Three ballot periods are anticipated:
</p>
<table class="grid">
 <tr>
   <td>Draft Ballot</td>
   <td>Apr - May 2021</td>
   <td>This ballot</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <td>Ballot #1</td>
   <td>Aug - Sept 2021</td>
   <td>The first full R5 ballot, both Normative and Trial Use content, split into multiple ballot packages (the exact details are yet to be resolved)</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><b>Follow up Ballot</b></td>
   <td>Dec - Jan 2021</td>
   <td><b>If necessary:</b> Reballoting of normative content where required, and significant new or revised Trial Use content</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>

What content has changed.
</p>

<h3>Balloting Guidelines</h3>
<p>
HL7 ballot rules require that participants sign up prior to opening of the ballot.  If you did not sign up in advance, you
can still submit comments using the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir-issues">Propose a Change</a>
link at the bottom of each page of the specification.  Feedback from balloters will be given priority but all suggestions will be
considered as much as time allows.  (And be sure to <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Mailing+List+Instructions">sign up</a> 
to the FHIR list-server and/or follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fhir">#FHIR</a> hash-tag so you don't miss the chance to 
vote in the next ballot cycle.)
</p>
<p>
If you are signed up to ballot, you can download the balloting spreadsheet from the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/participate/onlineballoting.cfm">Ballot Desktop</a>.
All ballot feedback must be provided using the spreadsheet template provided.  (There's a help tab that explains the meaning of each of the columns.)
For FHIR, you have the option of making your comments directly in the spreadsheet or submitting your comment using the FHIR
<a href="http://hl7.org/fhir-issues">Change Tracker</a> tool.  <b></b>  If you take the latter approach, you <b>must</b> include a reference to each tracker item in your
ballot spreadsheet along with a vote (negative, affirmative typo, etc.).  The other columns can (and should) be left blank.  All spreadsheets must be submitted along with an overall vote
by end of day Eastern time on the designated ballot closure date for the comments to be considered as part of ballot disposition.
</p>
<p style="background-color:yellow">
  <b>IMPORTANT:</b> We encourage  balloters to capture their comments using the HL7 issue tracker
  and to use the spreadsheet only to list their tracker item numbers and votes.  (If you include additional information beyond tracker item and vote, we 
  need to cross-check to ensure the content is aligned, which eliminates any savings.  So if you keep additional columns for internal review, please wipe them before submission.)
  Tracker-based comment submission dramatically reduces administrative overhead in managing the ballot.
  It also means that you can receive automatic notifications when your comment is scheduled for discussion, commented on, or resolved.  
</p>

<p>
When submitting your ballot feedback, if you have a general comment on something that you see occurring multiple times, please include 
at least a couple of specific locations where you see the issue.  As much as possible, capture each separate concern as a distinct row 
in the ballot sheet or separate <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir-issues">tracker item</a>.  (If using tracker items for your submissions, you <b>MUST</b> still
submit a ballot spreadsheet referencing the relevant tracker items.)  It makes our job of reconciling much easier.  Also, don't forget to 
fill in the section numbers (gray numbers to the left of each heading) and URLs.  Only one URL should be placed in the "url" element or column.  
If you want to reference additional URLs, include them in the text of your ballot comment.
</p>
<p>
If you have questions that are interfering with the ability to review the specification or submit ballot comments, please contact one of 
the co-chairs of the FHIR Management Group: <a href="mailto:lloyd@lmckenzie.com">Lloyd McKenzie</a> or 
<a href="mailto:david.hay25@gmail.com">David Hay</a>.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for taking the time to review the FHIR specification.  We appreciate any feedback you can provide.

<p>
The difference analysis in this ballot for resources is still between Release 3 and Release 4. This will be updated
when Release 5 is prior to publication of the final specification. In the meantime, balloters are welcome to comment on suggested 
improvements to the mappings and difference statements, but these cannot be the 
basis for negative votes. Contributions may also be made directly 
(join the <a href="https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/133-R3.2FR4-Conversion.20work">conversation at chat.fhir.org</a>).
