    </p>
    <p><strong>Clinical Reasoning</strong> is the ability to represent and
        encode clinical knowledge in a very broad sense so that it can be
        integrated into clinical systems. This encoding may be as simple as
        controlling whether or not a particular section of an order set appears
        based on the conditions that a patient has, or it may be as complex as
        representing the care pathway for a patient with multiple
        conditions.</p>
    <p><strong>Clinical Statement</strong> is an expression of a discrete
        item of clinical, clinically-related or public health information that
        is recorded because of its relevance to the care of patients (persons,
        animals and other entities).</p>
    <p><strong>code</strong> is a type of FHIR data types where a resource
        instance element represents the code only. The system is implicit- it is
        defined as part of the definition of the element, and not carried in the
        instance.</p>
    <p><strong>Coding</strong> is a type of FHIR data types where a resource
        instance element has a code and a system element that identifies where

        each diagnoses and procedure utilized in treating the patient.</p>
    <p><strong>CodeableConcept</strong> - A type of FHIR data types that
        represents a concept by plain text and/or one or more Coding
        elements.</p>

        components that represent other data types or structures required to
        build a sophisticated concept. (See Primitive data type)</p>
    <p><strong>Condition</strong> is a term to define patient's medical,
        problem, diagnosis, situation, issue, other event, or clinical concept
        that has risen to a level of concern.</p>
    <p><strong>Conditional Reference</strong> is a search URI that describes
        how to find the correct reference when the logical id of a resource is
        not known. Conditional Reference can be used only in Transaction. (See
        Transaction)</p>
    <p><strong>Code System</strong> define concepts and give them meaning
        through formal definitions, and assign codes that represent the
        concepts. Example: LOINC, ICD, UCUM, HL7 code lists</p>
    <p><strong>Coding System</strong> – see Code System.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Conformance Verb</strong> is a set verb form for indicating a
        requirement. HL7 FHIR specification uses the conformance verbs SHALL,
        SHOULD, and MAY as defined in RFC 2119. The correct verb for indicating
        an absolute requirement is “SHALL”. Universally accepted standardization
        terminology does not recognize "MUST". Use "SHALL" to indicate a
        mandatory aspect or an aspect on which there is no option. The correct
        verb form for indicating a recommendation is "SHOULD." The correct verb
        form for an option is "MAY." The negatives are SHALL NOT, SHOULD
        NOT.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Conditional Update</strong> is the FHIR RESTful API
        interaction that allows a client to update an existing resource based on
        some identification criteria, rather than by logical id.</p>
    <p><strong>Contained Resource</strong> is a resource within another
        resource when the content referred to in the resource reference does not
        have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains it.
        (See Bundle)</p>
    <p><strong>COB (Coordination of Benefit)</strong> are the rules, usually
        regionally defined, which govern the order of application of multiple
        Insurance coverages or Self-Pay to a given suite of health care
        expenses.</p>
    <p><strong>CORS</strong> (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a

        introduces a standard mechanism for implementing cross-domain
        requests.</p>

    <p><strong>Coverage</strong> is a financial instrument which may be used
        to reimburse or pay for health care products and services. Includes both
        insurance and self-payment. In context of FHIR, Coverage is a resource
        intended to provide the high-level identifiers and descriptors of an
        insurance plan, typically the information which would appear on an
        insurance card, which may be used to pay, in part or in whole, for the
        provision of health care products and services.</p>
    <p><strong>Coverage Extension</strong> is a form of Authorization where
        the Provider requests payment approval for extension of a Person's
        benefit coverage. Coverage Extensions require manual or human
        intervention and decision by the Adjudicator.</p>
