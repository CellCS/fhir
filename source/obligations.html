<p>
The FHIR specification is primarily concerned with valid interfaces of various kinds (APIs, messaging, etc)
and the rules for the content in resource instances exchanged between applications. Implementation guides 
that describe specific implementation solutions and <a href="actordefinition.html">application roles</a> 
are also concerned with application behavior - what information must be provided under what conditions, and 
setting expectations for how particular data elements are handled. 
</p>
<p>
Implementation guides can make rules about the behavior of applications by using the <code>mustSupport</code>
and <code>obligation</code> features of <a href="elementdefinition.html">ElementDefinition</a> in profiles. 
For further information, read <a href="obligations.html">Implementation Obligations</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note that since the base specification is only describing the interfaces and resources, not any particular 
solution, the base application does not specify any applications obligations in the resource definitions.
</p>

<a name="mustSupport"></a>
<h3>MustSupport</h3>
<p>
Any element can be labelled as 'must-support' using the <code>mustSupport</code> flag on an 
<a href="elementdefinition.html">Element Definition</a> in an applicable profile. Labeling an 
element MustSupport means that implementations that produce or consume resources SHALL
provide "support" for the element in some meaningful way.
</p>
<p>
The <code>mustSupport</code> flag itself does not define exactly what "support" for an element 
means. When a profile contains an element labelled as "must-support", it SHALL also make clear
exactly what kind of "support" is required, as this could involve expectations around what
a system must store, display, allow data capture of, include in decision logic, pass on to
other data consumers, etc.
</p>
<p>
Profiles can make the expectations clear by either:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Providing a narrative description of the obligations associated with the element 
    as part of an implementation guide in which the profile is published, or in the 
    narrative description of the element</li>
  <li>Providing detailed expectations about the element using the <code>obligation</code> element</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that an element that has the property IsModifier is not necessarily a "key" element (e.g. one of
the important elements to make use of the resource), nor is it automatically mustSupport - however both
of these things are more likely to be true for IsModifier elements than for other elements.
</p>  

<p>
The base FHIR specification is intended to be independent of any particular implementation context, 
so no elements are flagged as <code>mustSupport</code>=true as part of the base specification, and 
no obligations are defined for any elements (except for an example profile).

<a name="obligations"></a>
<h3>Obligations</h3>

<p>
If an element is labelled as "must-support", the element can specify the obligations associated
with it's use by providing one or more obligations. Each obligation has the following features:
</p>
<table lass="grid">
  <tr>
    <td>code</td>
    <td>
      one or more codes that specify the details of the obligation. The codes are taken from the 
      <a href="codesystem-obligation.html">Obligations Code system</a>. The codes say things like 
      'SHALL store this deta item', 'SHOULD populate this if a data element is available', or 
      'HL7 v2 expectations apply'. If multiple codes are specified, then all the obligations 
      apply. See below for more details about how the combination obligation 
      codes work.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>actor</td>
    <td>
      One or references to <a href="actordefinition.html">actors</a> that are involved in the 
      exchanges associated with the element. If any actors are indicated, then the obligations 
      are only associated with those actors; if no actors are indicated, the obligations apply 
      to all applications exchanging the element. Since this includes in any derived profiles,
      designers should be wary of defining obligations that don't have any associated actors.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>documentation</td>
    <td>
      Markdown documentation that provides additional information about the obligation, including
      it's rationale and justification
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>usage</td>
    <td>
      A set of qualifiers that restrict the scope of the obligation. Typically, the obligation is 
      restricted by jurisdiction/realm, but it may also be restricted to particular clinical or
      workflow contexts. This specification does not detail exactly how implementations determine 
      when usage criteria apply, so this is a subject that should be addressed in implementation 
      guides when usages are specified
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>filter</td>
    <td>
      A <a href="fhirpath.html">FHIRPath</a> expression that indicates a subset of elements to 
      which this obligation applies. This is typically used with elements with a max cardinality
      greater than 0. The same outcome can be achieved by slicing the element, but this has a
      real price for implementers, so a filter is preferred if the element is not sliced for 
      other reasons
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>filterDoco</td>
    <td>
      A human readable description of the filter. This SHOULD be provided if a filter is specified,
      for the benefit of readers not familiar with FHIRPath expressions.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>process</td>
    <td>
      One or more URIs that reference processes that involve handling the data element. The references
      may be to <a href="operationdefinition.html">Operations</a> defined by the FHIR specification, or 
      processed defined elsewhere, including in the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/57757.html">EHR-FM specification</a>.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Obligation Codes</h3>

<p>
There are two kinds of codes specified by the obligation codes coding system:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Duplicate codes combining "shall" or "should" with a functional code</li>
  <li>Composite codes that specify one or more combinations of duplicate codes</li>
</ul>
<p>
The functional codes are defined in three different groups, according to whether 
obligations apply to resource creators, consumers or applications that are just 
transferring them from one application to another (a category that includes general
purpose FHIR repositories). Note that actors, whether clients or servers or something
else, typically both create and consume resources.
